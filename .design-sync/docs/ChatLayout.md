# ChatLayout

ChatLayout is the layout shell for full-page chat interfaces. It renders messages in normal page flow and docks the composer to the bottom with a frosted glass blur layer. Density adapts automatically via container width observation. Use it to wrap ChatMessageList and ChatComposer for a complete chat experience with built-in auto-scroll and a scroll-to-bottom button.

**Import:** `import {ChatLayout} from '@astryxdesign/core/Chat';`

## Anatomy

| Element                 | Required | Description                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Message area            | Yes      | Scrollable region for messages. Renders children (typically ChatMessageList) in a flex column that pushes content to the bottom when the list is short. |
| Frosted glass dock      | Yes      | Sticky or fixed container at the bottom with a backdrop-blur layer. Houses the scroll button and composer.                                              |
| Scroll-to-bottom button | No       | Appears when the user scrolls up or new messages arrive. Defaults to ChatLayoutScrollButton; pass null to hide or a custom element to override.         |
| Composer                | Yes      | The input area for sending messages, typically ChatComposer. Docked at the bottom inside the frosted glass layer.                                       |
| Empty state             | No       | Centered placeholder shown when no messages exist. Use EmptyState for a consistent look.                                                                |

## Best Practices

- **Do:** Pass ChatMessageList as children and ChatComposer as the composer prop for a complete chat interface.
- **Do:** Provide an emptyState so new conversations show a prompt instead of a blank screen.
- **Do:** Use scrollRef when the chat is embedded in a page where a parent element handles scrolling.
- **Don't:** Don't apply a fixed height on the layout; let it fill its container with flex: 1.
- **Don't:** Don't render multiple ChatLayout instances in the same scroll container; each expects to own its scroll context.

## Props

| Prop           | Type                         | Default | Description                                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `children`     | `ReactNode`                  | —       | Message content: typically ChatMessageList. Flows naturally in the page and scrolls with the container. **(required)** |
| `composer`     | `ReactNode`                  | —       | Composer element: typically ChatComposer. Fixed to the bottom with a frosted glass dock. **(required)**                |
| `emptyState`   | `ReactNode`                  | —       | Content shown when children is empty. Centered vertically in the message area.                                         |
| `scrollButton` | `ReactNode                   | null`   | —                                                                                                                      | Scroll-to-bottom button rendered above the composer. Defaults to ChatLayoutScrollButton with auto-scroll integration. Pass null to hide.                                                                                    |
| `scrollRef`    | `React.RefObject<HTMLElement | null>`  | —                                                                                                                      | External scroll container ref. When provided, auto-scroll and scroll-to-bottom target this element instead of the layout root. Use when the chat is embedded in a page where a parent element or the document body scrolls. |
