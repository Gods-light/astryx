# ChatToolCalls

ChatToolCalls displays tool or function call invocations from an LLM response. Pass an array of calls and the component handles the rest: a single call renders inline, while multiple calls collapse into a summary with the latest call visible at the surface. Use it anywhere an AI agent shows what actions it took.

**Import:** `import {ChatToolCalls} from '@astryxdesign/core/Chat';`

## Anatomy

| Element      | Required | Description                                                                                                                     |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Status icon  | Yes      | A colored circle with a check, cross, or spinner indicating whether the call is pending, running, complete, or errored.         |
| Tool name    | Yes      | The function or tool name displayed in monospace: bash, edit, read, web_search, etc.                                            |
| Node badge   | No       | A neutral pill badge showing which sandbox or environment ran the tool, like cli:remote-server or workspace.                    |
| Target label | No       | The target of the action (a file path, command, or search query) shown after the tool name.                                     |
| Diff stats   | No       | Green additions and red deletions counts for edit operations, displayed inline after the target.                                |
| Duration     | No       | Execution time shown on the trailing edge for completed calls.                                                                  |
| Group header | No       | A wrench icon with a call count, shown when multiple calls are present. Clicking toggles between the summary and the full list. |

## Best Practices

- **Do:** Include a target string on every call so the user can see what the tool acted on: a file path, a shell command, or a search query.
- **Do:** Show a duration on completed calls so users can judge which tools are slow and understand why a response took time.
- **Do:** Provide resultDetail with a code block for calls that produce output (diffs for edits, terminal output for shell commands) so users can inspect results inline.
- **Do:** Set a unique key on each call item when streaming so React can animate additions without re-mounting completed rows.
- **Don't:** Don't omit the status field. Without it the call defaults to complete, which is misleading for calls that are still running or have failed.
- **Don't:** Don't display tool calls outside a chat message context; they are designed to sit inside an assistant message, not as standalone UI.
- **Don't:** Don't use custom wrappers around individual calls; the component handles single vs. grouped layout automatically based on the array length.

## Props

| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `calls`             | `ChatToolCallItem[]`            | —       | Array of tool call data. Each item has name, status, target, duration, node, additions, deletions, stats, errorMessage, resultDetail, key, and data. **(required)** |
| `label`             | `string`                        | —       | Custom summary label for groups. Auto-generated from count if omitted.                                                                                              |
| `isExpanded`        | `boolean`                       | —       | Controlled expanded state for the group.                                                                                                                            |
| `defaultIsExpanded` | `boolean`                       | `false` | Default expanded state when uncontrolled.                                                                                                                           |
| `onExpandedChange`  | `(isExpanded: boolean) => void` | —       | Callback fired when the expanded state changes.                                                                                                                     |
| `xstyle`            | `StyleXStyles`                  | —       | StyleX styles for layout customization (margins, positioning, sizing). Must be a stylex.create() value, not an inline style object like style={{}}.                 |
